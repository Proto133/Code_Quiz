# Code Quiz


## Application description:
The Javascript Code Quiz is a fun and interactive way to test your basic javascript code skills. With 15 questions, it will challenge you as you progress through the quiz. Complete with `localStorage` calls, this application invites you to challenge your friends to see who can score the highest in the shorest amount of time. The fun could last for about 20 minutes . . . *there's only 15 questions*. However; the leaderboard updates to the most recent 3 users for bragging rights. It`s a ~~great~~ way decent to brush up on those coding skills when there isn't anything else better to do ;)
